# Hi,

I'm *Utku Demir*, a software developer from Auckland, New Zealand.

I write Haskell (and sadly, a bunch of other stuff), use free software, and like speculative fiction.

I'm currently a part of [Movio][].

To get in touch, you can email me at me@utdemir.com. 

Also, here are some of my online profiles:
